# About Me

I’m Claudio, a mathematician who loves programming and data science.
I'm super focused on practical skills and getting outcomes trying not to overcomplicate pipelines and procedures.
I truly believe that simple approaches make beauty and maintainable processes.

Currently working in Santiago, Chile, coming from Padre Las Casas, La Araucanía Region, Chile.
I often participate in initiatives to extend Data Science and Big Data knowledge in my alma mater,
bringing more professionals to the field.

Additionally, my only one hobby is to be a big fan of Pokémon, carrying my passion from 6 yo,
my interest includes play Pokémon games and collecting figures.
My current collection contains over 400 different figures, dating from 1997 up to date, which makes me pretty proud.

An important detail is that my collectables are only [Tomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomy) brand
in order to have at least a chance of completing the collection someday jeje.
