## Profile

Data Scientist with 5 years of experience performing machine learning models, software development,
cloud computing and custom algorithms in order to face business problems correctly.

At university, I derived my efforts into parallel programming and its logic to optimize at max codes.
And at work, those efforts and my maths skills finally converged into Data Science with Big Data.

As far as I have observed, the desire of self-improvement and the persistent intention of acquiring new knowledge are a must.
In addition, I consider myself easy going, super proactive and absolutely collaborative because making the most of teamwork
is the best approach for bringing projects to success.
